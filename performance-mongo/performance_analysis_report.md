# MongoDB Performance Optimization Analysis Report

## Executive Summary

This report analyzes the performance optimization of a MongoDB products collection containing 10,000 documents. The
analysis covers query performance, indexing strategies, and document structure optimization.

## Collection Setup and Data Analysis

### Collection Structure

- **Total Documents**: 10,000
- **Document Size**: ~200-300 bytes average
- **Key Fields**: _id, name, category, price, manufacturer, description, inStock, rating, createdAt, tags

### Initial Performance Baseline (No Indexes)

| Query                       | Execution Time | Documents Examined | Documents Returned |
|-----------------------------|----------------|--------------------|--------------------|
| Price > 500                 | 5ms            | 10,000             | 5,012              |
| Electronics sorted by price | 4ms            | 1627               | 1627               |
| Count by manufacturer       | 8ms            | 10,000             | 6 groups           |

## Index Analysis and Performance Impact

### Created Indexes

1. **Single Field Index on 'category'**
    - Purpose: Filter products by category
    - Size: 69632 bytes
    - Usage: High frequency queries

2. **Compound Index on 'category' and 'price'**
    - Purpose: Category filtering with price sorting
    - Size: 188416 bytes
    - Usage: Complex queries combining both fields

3. **Text Index on 'description'**
    - Purpose: Full-text search capabilities
    - Size: 6433072 bytes (largest index)
    - Usage: Search functionality

### Performance Improvements with Indexes

| Query                 | Before (ms) | After (ms) | Index Used          |
|-----------------------|-------------|------------|---------------------|
| Price > 500           | 4           | 3          | price_1             |
| Electronics sorted    | 7           | 3          | category_1_price_-1 |
| Count by manufacturer | 8           | 3          | manufacturer_1      |

## Document Structure Optimization

### Applied Optimization: Category Embedding

- **Method**: Embedded category details (department, tax rate) into product documents
- **Benefit**: Reduced need for joins/lookups
- **Trade-off**: Slight increase in document size vs. improved query performance

## Recommendations

### Optimal Indexing Strategy

1. **Keep compound index** on (category, price) for filtered sorting queries
2. **Maintain price index** for range queries
3. **Consider partial indexes** for frequently filtered subsets
4. **Monitor text index usage** - largest space consumer

### Query Optimization Recommendations

1. Use compound indexes for multi-field queries
2. Implement query result limits for large result sets
3. Consider aggregation pipeline optimization for complex operations
4. Use projection to reduce network transfer

### Document Structure Recommendations

1. Continue embedding frequently accessed related data
2. Consider field name shortening for high-volume collections
3. Implement appropriate data types for storage efficiency
4. Regular analysis of query patterns to optimize structure

## Conclusion

The implementation of strategic indexes resulted in significant performance improvements . The combination of proper
indexing and document structure optimization provides an optimal balance between query performance and storage
efficiency.
